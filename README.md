## What is your developer journey so far? What brought you to this major, and why did you take this class?
	
I decided to get into computer science during the summer of 2017. Since I had no experience in coding, it was recommended that I take the COSC 175 course. After that I took COSC 236 during that Spring semester, and 237 the following summer. Those two classes introduced me to coding in DrJava, and closed my huge knowledge gap on the language. During the Spring semester I was briefly introduced to HTML in my COSC 109 course. I enjoyed learning to use the language and seeing the possibilities that come with developing websites. Because of that class, I am now taking 484 in order to get a better grasp of web based programming.
    

## What is your ideal career progression, if there were no limitations?
	
I am not completely certain about my career progression. However, I would like to end up working for companies that have a heavy involvement with either developing robotics or artificial intelligence. I would also like to work with a company to help develop software for military or medical use along the line. Companies such as Boston Dynamics and DARPA have created some very interesting projects that inspire me to work with these types of companies.

## What programming experience do you have? Do you have any web experience?
	
I am most familiar with Java, and somewhat basic in C++. I have an extremely small amount of experience in HTML.
